A single API call is made per month, resulting in a gridded data response file with a default resolution of 0.1 degree latitude/longitude. Each month and region corresponds to one variable, resulting in over 20.000 files. The performance of this process is relatively slow, taking around a minute per call, and it requires a substantial number of calls to collect the complete dataset. There are over 12.000 raw input files in NetCDF4 format covering the period from 1990 to 2022.",

External experts perform quality checks on the merged data, which could be either a one-off or a regular quality assurance check.

It also addresses unit differences, converting Kelvin to Celsius and meters to millimeters. The data is then grouped by date, variable, and region, and temperature is averaged while also obtaining maximum and minimum values, accumulating precipitation by date, and identifying the maximum wind gust value. Moving averages are calculated for variables using different time windows (7-day, 30-day, 90-day, 365-day). Baseline values for temperature, precipitation, wind gust, and deviations from the baseline (anomalies) are determined based on the period from 1991 to 2020. Data older than 2015 is removed, and a group-by operation is performed, collapsing the data by region using population-weighted averages. It is important to note that the ERA5 data may contain imputed and missing values. In memory, each row corresponds to a region, with mesh-blocks aggregated per day to calculate region-level values by taking the average of all variables weighted by the population of each block. The resulting data is stored to disk in CSV, SAV, or other suitable formats, as the data size remains manageable.",
