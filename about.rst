About
=====

This application shows detailed information about the data integration process of climate data
from Copernicus ERA5 and air quality data from the European Environmental Agency (EEA)
with data from the European Social Survey (ESS). More information is available at the related project description
at `ESS LABS <https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/esslabs/>`_.

The used process description application prototype "ddi-cdi_process2web" displays process activities
structured according to the specification `DDI Cross Domain Integration (DDI-CDI) <https://ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-CDI/>`_.

The development tools used in the creation of "ddi-cdi_process2web" are all freely available,
and the program code can be found at the `related github repository <https://github.com/sikt-no/ddi-cdi_process2web>`_.

**DISCLAIMER:** The "ddi-cdi_process2web" tool is a prototype developed to explore issues around the presentation of process information
to researchers. As such, only limited time and resources were available for its creation.
It is not intended to be used as a production tool in its current form, but to serve as an example for developers
interested in these types of applications. The current tool is intended for display on a computer screen,
without consideration of mobile design or other possible scenarios which might require support in a production tool.
It does not cover all of the possible fields in the DDI-CDI model for describing processes,
but only the selection of fields used in the example for the EOSC Futures Science Project 9
"Climate Neutral and Smart Cities" which focus on a process sequence.
